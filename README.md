# women-in-the-museum

Data from the [Tate Art Museum]( https://github.com/tategallery/collection). 

This work's goal is to reflect on the lack of works from women in the museums (Tate, in this case).
It consists of a main visualization where the museum walls are reimagined to picture what they would look like if only artworks made by women were left.
